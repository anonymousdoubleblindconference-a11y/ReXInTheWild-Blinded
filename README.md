**ReXInTheWild (Anonymized Repository)**

To ensure anonymity during the review process, we provide our data and workflow prompts through a new GitHub account.

Our images and question-answer pairs (qa_pairs.csv) are available in the data folder. Each row in the .csv file corresponds to the image at path "{pmcid}_{image_file_name}".
